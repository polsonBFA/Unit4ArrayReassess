# Instructions  
Complete the following methods: createWedge and printArray as described below:

// Returns an array filled with values
// 1, 2, ... , n-1, n, n-1, ... , 2, 1
// Precondition: n > = 1
For example, createWedge(3) returns the array {1, 2, 3, 2, 1];
```java
public static int[] createWedge(int n)
{

}
```
Write a method called ```javaprintArray``` that receives an array as a parameter, and prints out the array in a neat, readable way as seen in the example below:

[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]
